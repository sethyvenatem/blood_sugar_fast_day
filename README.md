# Blood sugar fast day

I am type 1 diabetic and require a constant monitoring of my glycemia (the concentration of glucose in my blood) in order to treat myself. I wear a continuous glucose monitor at all times and my glycemia is measured every 5 minutes. The goal of the treatment is to keep the glycemia in range. This is done by balancing the glucose intake (basically food) with insulin shots. At the beginning of July 2024, I did a 24 hours fast. This provided me with simplified data to analyse. Indeed, en everyday life, the three main components of diabetes treatment insulin, glucose and exercise, all happen together. For example, I inject insulin just before I eat my lunch so that both components compensate each other. In this simplified data set, I have 6 events where only one of the components is acting, independently from the others.

In this project, I analyse these events with a focus on time scales. In particular, I measure the time-scales on which each components affects my glycemia. Take a look at the analysis and results in the jupyter notebook [fast_day.ipnb](https://github.com/sethyvenatem/blood_sugar_fast_day/blob/main/fast_day.ipynb).

I am not a medical professional. This is a personal project to learn about my diabetes and practice my data analysis skills.
